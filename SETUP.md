# LessonTrack Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up LessonTrack for your organization. Follow these steps carefully to ensure all sensitive information is properly configured.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Google Cloud Platform account
- OpenAI API account + key
- Google Workspace account (for Gmail API)

## Step 1: Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Lesson_Track-main
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```bash
   # OpenAI API Configuration
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   
   # Google Sheets URLs (replace with your actual sheet URLs)
   TUTOR_INFO_CSV_URL=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_TUTOR_INFO_SHEET_ID/export?format=csv
   RESPONSE_CSV_URL=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_FORM_RESPONSES_SHEET_ID/export?format=csv
   REPRESENTATIVE_CSV_URL=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_REPRESENTATIVES_SHEET_ID/export?format=csv&gid=0
   
   # Google Form and Drive URLs
   FORM_SUBMISSION_URL=https://forms.gle/YOUR_FORM_ID
   DRIVE_FOLDER_URL=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/YOUR_FOLDER_ID?usp=sharing
   
   # Email Configuration
   MANAGEMENT_EMAIL=management@yourcompany.com
   SYSTEM_NAME=LessonTrack
   COMPANY_NAME=Your Company Name
   ```

## Step 3: Google Cloud Platform Setup

### 3.1 Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable billing for the project

### 3.2 Enable Required APIs

Enable these APIs in your Google Cloud project:
- Gmail API
- Google Drive API
- Google Sheets API

### 3.3 Create Gmail API Credentials

1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
3. Choose "Desktop application"
4. Download the JSON file and save it as `gmail_credentials.json` in the project root

### 3.4 Create Google Sheets Service Account

1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "Service Account"
3. Fill in the service account details
4. Create a new key (JSON format)
5. Download and save as `sheets_credentials.json` in the project root

## Step 4: Google Sheets Setup

### 4.1 Create Required Google Sheets and Google Form

You need three Google Sheets:

1. **Tutor Information Sheet** - Master list of tutors and their data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jVd3Z0B6m473hRit97pOPY5X4JlvtnHr7Ejbfqu--cE/edit?gid=0#gid=0
2. **Form Responses Sheet** - Linked to your Google Form: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jsAlYtYc_l_wLGlSaY3Wc3p6zRf5x4ysUa4WUswWg6U/edit?gid=1948304920#gid=1948304920
3. **Representatives Sheet** - List of school representatives: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1btZE7ezSMx6XTpIKSHkbiWC5_PL5I4N3G2Oq71ki-xQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0

### 4.2 Share Sheets with Service Account

1. Get the service account email from `sheets_credentials.json` (look for `client_email`)
2. Share each Google Sheet with this email address
3. Grant "Editor" access to the service account

### 4.3 Set Up Sheet Structure

#### Tutor Information Sheet Columns:
- `Tutor Name`
- `Tutor School`
- `Grad Year`
- `Email`
- `Phone`
- `Total Lessons` (initially 0)
- `Total Submissions` (initially 0)
- `Total Hours` (initially 0.0)
- `Last Processed Timestamp` (initially blank)

#### Form Responses Sheet:
- Must be linked to your Google Form
- Should have a column for tutor name selection
- Must have a `Timestamp` column

#### Representatives Sheet:
- `Name`
- `School`
- `Email`
- `Phone`

## Step 5: Google Form Setup

1. Create a Google Form for weekly tutor reports
2. Link it to the Form Responses Sheet
3. Include questions for:
   - Tutor name selection
   - Whether they taught this week
   - Number of hours taught
   - Any additional notes

This is the structure of the google form:

## Step 6: OpenAI API Setup

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Create an account and get an API key
3. Add the API key to your `.env` file

## Step 7: Test the Setup

### 7.1 Test Email System
```bash
python test_email.py
```

### 7.2 Test Sunday Logic (without sending emails)
```bash
python test_sunday_no_email.py
```

### 7.3 Test Monday Reminders
```bash
python Monday.py
```

### 7.4 Test Full Sunday Process
```bash
python Sunday.py
```

## Step 8: Run the frontend
run the app.py file or use the command "python app.py" in the terminal from the root folder.

## Step 8: Automation Setup

### For Local Development:
- Set up cron jobs or Windows Task Scheduler
- Run `Monday.py` every Monday
- Run `Sunday.py` every Sunday

### For Production:
- Consider using GitHub Actions, AWS Lambda, or similar cloud services
- Set up proper logging and monitoring
- Implement error handling and notifications

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit credential files to Git**
   - The `.gitignore` file is already configured to exclude them
   - Always use environment variables for sensitive data

2. **Rotate credentials regularly**
   - Update API keys periodically
   - Monitor for unusual activity

3. **Limit API permissions**
   - Only grant necessary permissions to service accounts
   - Use principle of least privilege

4. **Monitor costs**
   - Set up billing alerts for OpenAI API usage
   - Monitor Google Cloud API usage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Missing required environment variables"**
   - Check that your `.env` file exists and has all required variables
   - Ensure no spaces around the `=` sign in `.env` file

2. **"Gmail authentication failed"**
   - Ensure `gmail_credentials.json` exists and is valid
   - Run the script locally first to generate `gmail_token.json`

3. **"Google Sheets permission denied"**
   - Verify the service account email has access to all sheets
   - Check that sheet URLs are correct and accessible

4. **"OpenAI API error"**
   - Verify your API key is correct and has sufficient credits
   - Check OpenAI service status

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure all Google Sheets are properly shared with the service account
4. Test each component individually using the test scripts
